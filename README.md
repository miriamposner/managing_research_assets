# managing_research_assets
These are materials, including a handout and Keynote slides, for a workshop on managing research assets, aimed at humanists (including historians) who have a lot of research files and are looking for ways to sort and search them. I first started offering this workshop in 2011 and last updated it in 2013.  

I've included a handout (in Word, PDF, and Markdown versions), the cursory notes I use when presenting this material, and a couple of basic Keynote slide decks.
